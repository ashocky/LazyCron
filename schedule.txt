# Usage Notes:
# This is a tab delimimted file. Make sure you have actual tabs enabled in your text editor (or at least use 4 spaces between fields)
# Use * for fields that you don't need to fill in.

# "Time" is the window is when the script is allowed to run. You can have multiple windows seperated with commas. For example: 1-3am, 2pm-4m, 11:30-11:34 - Play around with these numbers, the system is very flexible. When you run my script it will show you the next time window available for each program.

# Not sure if your schedule will work correctly? Run the program with the --testing option to show what it would do.

# "Frequency" is how often the program. m = minutes, h = hours and so on. My script should allow most natural language inputs here. Set as * and it will only run once a day.

# Requirements is a comma seperated list of additional requirements needed for the script to run. Available ones are as follows:
#     idle    = Time the computer has been idle for
#     plugged = Power cord must be attached
#     closed  = Lid must be closed
#     random  = Script will run randomly. On average it will run every so many minutes.


#Examples:

#Days            #Time                Frequency        Requirements            Script Path
*                9:30-11, 3pm-5pm    *                idle 5m, plugged         # ./backup_script_path_goes_here.sh
*                -5pm                *                random 8h                # ./A_surprise_everyday.py
*                4-6pm               *                *                        # mpg123 'Libera - Going Home.mp3'
*                *                   *                *                        # ./a_daily_script.py
