# Usage Notes:
# This is a tab delimited file. Make sure you have actual tabs enabled in your text editor
# (or at least use 4 spaces between fields)
# Use * for fields that you don't need to fill in.

# "Time" is the window is when the script is allowed to run. You can have multiple windows separated with commas. For example: 1-3am, 2pm-4m, 11:30-11:34 - Play around with these numbers, the system is very flexible. When you run my script it will show you the next time window available for each program.

# "Frequency" is how often the program. m = minutes, h = hours and so on. My script should allow most natural language inputs here. Set as * and it will only run once a day.

# "Date" field can limit it to run on certain days of the week:
Example m-f, every 2nd Thursday

# Requirements is a comma separated list of additional requirements needed for the script to run. Available ones are as follows:
#     idle    = Time the computer has been idle for
#     plugged = Power cord must be attached
#     closed  = Lid must be closed
#     random  = Script will run randomly. On average it will run every so many minutes.



#Examples:

#Time              Frequency     Date              Requirements            Script Path
8:30pm-3am         1h            sat-sun           idle 5m, plugged        # ./backup_script_path_goes_here.sh
-5pm               *             m-f               random 8h               # ./A_surprise_everyday.py
4-6pm              *             2nd Thursday      *                       # mpg123 'Libera - Going Home.mp3'
*                  *             *                 *                       # ./a_daily_script.py
*                  *             March 14          *                       # ./pi_day.py


# Not sure if your schedule will work correctly? Run the program with the --testing option to show what it would do. or just put a # before each script path.
